        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>Here are some of the frequently asked questions.</p>
        <div class="FAQ-container" data-FAQ="FAQ-1">
            <button class="btn" data-FAQ="FAQ-1">1. What makes a web development service actually profitable for a beginner?</button>
            <p class="FAQ-text" data-FAQ="FAQ-1">High-ticket offers for local businesses (e.g., dentists, gyms, contractors) where you charge €800–€2000 per site and focus on clear ROI like more bookings or leads, 
                not just “nice design.” Profit comes from positioning as a solution provider, not a coder.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="FAQ-container" data-FAQ="FAQ-2">
            <button class="btn" data-FAQ="FAQ-2">2. How should you realistically get your first 5 paying clients?</button>
            <p class="FAQ-text" data-FAQ="FAQ-2">Manual outreach. Identify 50–100 local businesses with outdated websites, record short personalized Loom videos showing what’s wrong, and offer a simple improvement with a fixed price. 
                Expect low response rates; volume matters more than perfection.</p>

        <div class="FAQ-container" data-FAQ="FAQ-3">
            <button class="btn" data-FAQ="FAQ-3">3. What separates people who talk about business from those who make money?</button>
            <p class="FAQ-text" data-FAQ="FAQ-3">Execution frequency. The ones making money send offers daily, talk to real customers, adjust based on rejection, and track numbers. 
                The others optimize systems, branding, or learning without selling.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="FAQ-container" data-FAQ="FAQ-4">
            <button class="btn" data-FAQ="FAQ-4">4. What is the fastest way to increase income as a developer?</button>
            <p class="FAQ-text" data-FAQ="FAQ-4">Increase deal size, not workload. Instead of building 10 cheap sites, sell fewer premium offers with hosting, maintenance, SEO, or monthly retainers. Recurring revenue compounds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="FAQ-container" data-FAQ="FAQ-5">
            <button class="btn" data-FAQ="FAQ-5">5. When should you pivot or quit an idea?</button>
            <p class="FAQ-text" data-FAQ="FAQ-5">If after consistent outreach (e.g., 100–200 quality attempts) there is no demand, no responses, or no willingness to pay. 
                Lack of validation means the market does not value it — move to a more painful, urgent problem.</p>
